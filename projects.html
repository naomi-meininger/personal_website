                  <p> In Spring 2024, I developed a network incident detection tool that enables users to identify potential vulnerabilities and security breaches in 
                   network traffic using live network streams or sets of PCAP files for various security incidents. For the sake of
                  academic integrity, I cannot share the code but I can share the results of the code.</p>

                  <h3>Personal Project: Theta Budget Tracker!</h3>
                  <p> In my sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta, I am the VP of Finance and therefore am in charge of managing the budget. However, other executive board members
                        have to ask me about the budget for their specific events instead of being able to check it themselves. In turn, I created this platform
                        that uses Selenium to scrape my VP of Finance account and access budget information based off one's request.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                                In my sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta, we have a points system. If you miss events without an excuse, you lose points. If you go to non-required events, you gain points.
                                To be in good standing and be able to go to fun events such as formal, you must be at 0 or positive points. Currently, members have no way of knowing their point values 
                                without reaching out to the VP of Administration, who keeps track of everyone's points. We also cannot just have an excel spreadsheet for everyone to 
                                view because points are supposed to be private. In order to fix this issue, I created the Theta Tracker. Each user is given a unique password, 
                                which they can use to login to this website and check their points. Additionally, I added a dues checker as well since I am VP of Finances and 
                                would like to consolidate all of this information into one program. There also is a feature for members to check when their points and dues were last updated.

                  <h3>Mathematical Modeling: Music and Math</h3>
                  <p> In Spring 2022, I, along with my classmates Scott Fullenbaum and Grace Hindermann, worked to model and quantify the evolution of music, 
                        along with showing how a multitude of influences have shaped music history. We approached the problem by using three different ways 
                        to evaluate and model the influence of music over time: a directed graph among artists, least squares regression looking at data vs 
                        time, and Neural Networks classifying music by genre. The results of each method are detailed in the paper.</p>

                                In Fall 2022, my programming partner, Stephen Chakoudian, and I applied a Discrete Cosine Transformation and bit packing techniques 
                                to compress a ppm image to a binary file. We utilized bitwise operations to decompress a binary file to a ppm image while averaging 2% data loss.
